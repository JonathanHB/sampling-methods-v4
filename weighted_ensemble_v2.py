# x, e, w, cb, and b are all lists or arrays of length equal to the number of walkers at the start of the WE round
#      the i-th element of each array corresponds to the same walker
#   x = coordinates or state indices
#   e = ensembles (for history augmented analysis)
#   w = weights
#   cb = configurational bins
#   b = bins (equal to the configurational bins for non-history-augmented binning schemes)
# propagator: a class with a propagate() method that runs the dynamics (starting from x) 
#    and updates the metadynamics grid if it exists (this is why w is included as an argument)
# split_merge: a function that takes in weights, bins, a tuple of the other walker-level parameters, 
#    and the target number of walkers per bin and returns the above walker-level parameters for 
#    walkers which have been split and merged to yield the target walker number
# config_binner: a class with a bin() method that bins walkers based on their current coordinates
# ensemble_classifier: a class with an ensemble() method that determines which ensembles walkers are in 
#    based on their configurational bins plus their most recent ensembles
# binner: a class with a bin() method that determines which bins walkers are in based on their configurational bins and ensembles
#    the ensemble is ignored and the configurational bin is returned unchanged for non-history-augmented binning schemes
# calc_observables: a function that calculates observables based on the walker-level parameters from before and after dynamics were run
#    this is included here instead of just returning trajectories of the walker-level parameters because it avoids having to 
#    construct and use a parent-to-child walker mapping or pass information between WE segments from different function calls. 
#    This approach would break down if we needed to compute observables across more than two adjacent WE rounds (i.e. for an MSM of variable lag time)
#    but haMSMs work best with the shortest available lag time and are better for computing rates than regular ones so I see no occasion for that.

#         Each element is 1 if the walker was spawned, 0 otherwise. This should match the NaNs in the above two parameters.
